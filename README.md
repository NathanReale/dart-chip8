## Chip-8 Emulator in Dart

A fully working Chip-8 emulator written in Dart. Tested on a few different roms
(tetris, space invaders, etc.), and everything appears to be working correctly.

Implemented in 24 hours. There could definitely be some improvements in the presentation,
such as allowing users to change emulation speed.
